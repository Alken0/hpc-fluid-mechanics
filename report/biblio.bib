    abstract = "{Over the past near three decades, the Lattice Boltzmann method has gained a prominent role as an efficient computational method for the numerical simulation of a wide variety of complex states of flowing matter across a broad range of scales, from fully developed turbulence, to multiphase micro-flows, all the way down to nano-biofluidics and lately, even quantum-relativistic subnuclear fluids. After providing a self-contained introduction to the kinetic theory of fluids and a thorough account of its transcription to the lattice framework, this book presents a survey of the major developments which have led to the impressive growth of the Lattice Boltzmann across most walks of fluid dynamics and its interfaces with allied disciplines, such as statistical physics, material science, soft matter and biology. This includes recent developments of Lattice Boltzmann methods for non-ideal fluids, micro- and nanofluidic flows with suspended bodies of assorted nature and extensions to strong non-equilibrium flows beyond the realm of continuum fluid mechanics. In the final part, the book also presents the extension of the Lattice Boltzmann method to quantum and relativistic fluids, in an attempt to match the major surge of interest spurred by recent developments in the area of strongly interacting holographic fluids, such as quark-gluon plasmas and electron flows in graphene. It is hoped that this book may provide a source information and possibly inspiration to a broad audience of scientists dealing with the physics of classical and quantum flowing matter across many scales of motion.}",
