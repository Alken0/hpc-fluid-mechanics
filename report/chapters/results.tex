\section{Shear Wave Decay}
The Shear Wave Decay is a common concept in computational physics to measure the kinematic viscosity of a fluid.
It is setup by creating an initial sinusoidal velocity profile and measuring the decay rate.

\subsection{Sinusodial Density}
The initial condition is a given by the following equation where $L_x$ resembles the size in x-direction

\begin{equation*}
    \begin{aligned}
        \mathbf{u}(\mathbf{r},0) &= 0 \\
        \rho(\mathbf{r},0) &= \rho_0 + \epsilon \sin \left( \frac{2 \pi x}{L_x} \right) \cdot
    \end{aligned}
\end{equation*}

\subsection{Sinusodial Velocity}
The initial condition is a given by the following equation where $L_x$ resembles the size in x-direction

\begin{equation*}
    \begin{aligned}
        u_x(\mathbf{r},0) &= \epsilon \sin \left( \frac{2 \pi x}{L_x} \right) \\
        \rho(\mathbf{r},0) &= 1 \cdot
    \end{aligned}
\end{equation*}
